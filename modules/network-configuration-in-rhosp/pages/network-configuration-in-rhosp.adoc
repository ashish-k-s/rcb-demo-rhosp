= Network Configuration in RHOSP

Network configuration in Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) revolves around Neutron, the project responsible for managing networking as a service. Neutron provides an extensible framework allowing the integration of various networking technologies and plugins. It enables the creation and management of networks, subnets, routers, and load balancers.

Key aspects include:
- **Networks**: Logical constructs representing isolated IP spaces within RHOSP.
- **Subnets**: Subdivisions of networks with specific IP ranges used for instance communication.
- **Routers**: Facilitate communication between different subnets and networks, enabling traffic routing.
- **Load Balancing**: Integrates with HAProxy for distributing incoming traffic across multiple instances, enhancing availability and scalability.

Understanding Neutron's components and configuration is crucial for setting up robust and flexible network environments in RHOSP deployments.
