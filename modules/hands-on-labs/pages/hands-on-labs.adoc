#  Hands-on Labs

= Hands-on Labs

The hands-on labs provide practical experience with Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP). These exercises are designed to reinforce theoretical understanding and enable users to perform real-world tasks. Key activities include:

- User management exercises, where learners create users, roles, and projects, gaining hands-on experience with Keystone, the OpenStack identity service.
- Deploying virtual machines using Nova (compute) and Glance (image), illustrating the interaction between these services for effective VM creation.
- Configuring networks and setting up load balancing with HAProxy, offering insights into Neutron networking and related RHOSP components.
