#  Overview of OpenStack architecture

- **OpenStack Architecture Overview**

  - OpenStack is an open-source cloud computing platform comprising various services that control hardware resources in data centers.
  - Key services include:
    - **Nova**: Responsible for managing and provisioning virtual machines (VMs).
    - **Glance**: An image service for discovering, registering, and delivering disk images.
    - **Keystone**: Provides identity service, authentication, and authorization for all OpenStack services.
  - These services collaborate to offer infrastructure as a service (IaaS) cloud computing functionalities such as virtual machine deployment, managing storage, and configuring networks.
  - Other projects like Cinder (block storage), Swift (object storage), and Horizon (dashboard) complement this core set of services, forming a comprehensive ecosystem for cloud management.
